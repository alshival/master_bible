1,1,4,"God looked upon the light and found it to be good, then divided it from the darkness."
1,1,5,God referred to the light as Day and the darkness as Night. Evening and morning marked the passing of the first day. 
1,1,6,"God then commanded that a divide be created between the waters, separating them from one another. "

1,1,8,"God named the expanse Heaven. Then evening and morning came, ending the second day."
1,1,9,"God commanded  ``let the waters beneath the heavens gather as one, and let the dry land be revealed'', and so it was."
1,1,10,"God named the dry land Earth and the waters that had come together Seas, and God was pleased with what they saw."
1,1,11,"Then God commanded ``Let the earth produce grass, plants that bear seeds, and fruit trees that bear fruit with seeds'', and so it was."
1,1,12,"Vegetation and plants of various kinds were created by the earth, each with its own type of seed, and trees that produced fruit with their own seeds, and God was pleased with what they saw. "
1,1,13,"Then evening and morning came, ending the third day."
1,1,14,"Then God commanded ``Let lights be placed in the sky to divide day from night. They shall serve as signs for the passage of time and for the seasons,"
1,1,15,"and let their light shine in the sky to illuminate the earth'', and so it was. "
1,1,16,"God created two luminous bodies, the larger one to preside over the day and the smaller one to oversee the night beside the stars. "
1,1,17,"God placed them in the heavens to illuminate the earth, "
1,1,18,"to have dominion over the day and night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God was pleased with what they saw. "

1,1,26,"Then God commanded ``Let people made in our image walk the earth, and give them authority over all the fish that move through the water, as well as every type of bird, as well as the cattle, and all the crawling critters, and the wild beasts.''"
1,1,27,"Then God created the people in their reflection, in the image of God; male and female, God created them."
1,1,28,"God blessed the people and said ``Be fruitful and multiply, and take charge of the earth, as well as all the fish that move through the waters, as well as every type of bird, and the cattle, and the crawling critters, and even the wild beasts''."
1,1,29,"Then God said ``I have provided all the grass, the plants that bear seeds, and the fruit trees that bear fruit with seeds, which you can use as food,"
1,1,30,"and all the fish that move through the water, as well as every type of bird, and the cattle, and all crawling critters, and even the wild beasts.'', and so it was."

1,2,5,"A mist rose from the ground and moistened the surface of the land."
1,2,6,"God then crafted Adam from the dust of the earth and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, thus creating a living being."
1,2,7,"God planted a beautiful garden in Eden, to the east, and placed Adam there. God grew all sorts of trees in the Garden. They were pleasing to the eye and their fruit was nutritious."
1,2,8,"In the center of the garden stood two trees:"
1,2,9,"The Tree of Life and The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil."
1,2,10,"A river flowed through Eden providing water for the garden, which split into four branches."
1,2,11,"Pishon was the first of the rivers, and it encircled the entire country of Havilah, a place abundant in gold. The gold found in that land was of exceptional quality, as was the bdellium and onyx stones."
1,2,12,"Gihon was the second river; it encircled the entire region of Cush."
1,2,13,"The third river was called the Tigris, which flowed east of Assyria."

1,2,20,"Adam named all the fish that move through the water, as well as every type of bird, and the cattle, and all crawling critters, and even the wild beasts, but Adam could not find his companion."
1,2,21,"God caused Adam to fall into a deep slumber, and he drifted off to sleep. He then removed one of Adam's ribs and sealed up the wound."
1,2,22,"God then crafted Eve from the rib He had taken from Adam, and presented her to him."
1,2,23,"Adam had found his companion. ``She is a part of me, my equal; she shall be called: woman.''"
