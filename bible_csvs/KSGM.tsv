777	1	1	``Will matter be destroyed?''
777	1	2	The Savior said:
777	1	3	``Every form of nature, every creature, exists in each other, but each will dissolve into their own root, for the nature of matter is that it breaks down to things of its nature alone. Those that have an ear, let them hear.''
777	1	4	Peter said to Him: ``As you have told us all about matter, tell us this: what is the sin of the world?''
777	1	5	The Savior answered:
777	1	6	``There is no sin of the world. It is you who make sin exist when you do things, like adultery. This is what we call sin.
777	1	7	Because of this, the Lord comes into your midst, to restore nature within the roots.''
777	1	8	Then He continued:
777	1	9	``This is why you get sick and why you die, for you love that which deceives you.
777	1	10	Those that have an ear, let them hear.
777	1	11	Matter gave rise to a passion which was not there in the original image, which came from something against nature. From that, a disturbance overtakes the body.
777	1	12	This is why I tell you: be content of heart and if you be discontent find content in the presence of nature.
777	1	13	Those who have an ear, let them hear.''
777	1	14	When the Blessed One had said these things, He greeted them and said:
777	1	15	``Peace be to you, and may my peace be acquired within you.
777	1	16	Be careful. Let nobody mislead you by saying
777	1	17	Look, here in this direction!' or 'Look, here in this place!'.
777	1	18	The Son of Man exists within you.
777	1	19	Those that seek Him, find Him.
777	1	20	Go then, and spread the Gospel of the Kingdom.
777	1	21	Do not lay any rules down beyond what I have told you, nor give laws like the lawgiver,
777	1	22	lest they bind you by them.''
777	2	23	When He said these things, He went, and the people began to weep:
777	2	24	``How will we go up to the Gentiles and preach the gospel of the Kingdom of the Son of Man?
777	2	25	If they did not spare him, how will they spare us?''
777	2	26	Then Mary arose and said to her brothers:
777	2	27	``Do not weep nor grieve, nor break your heart, for His grace will be with you all. It will protect you. Rather, let us praise His greatness, for He has prepared us and made us humans.''
777	2	28	When Mary said these things, she turned their hearts towards the Lord and they started to debate about the words of the Savior.
777	2	29	Peter said to Mary: ``Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than all the other women. Tell us of any of the Savior's words you remember which we ourselves have not yet heard.''
777	2	30	Then Mary said:
777	2	31	``I will tell you that which was hidden from you.
777	2	32	I saw the Lord in a vision and I said to him this:
777	2	33	`Lord, I can see you in this vision'.
777	2	34	He answered:
777	2	35	`You are blessed for you are not intimidated by the sight of me;
777	2	36	There where is the mind is the treasure.'
777	2	37	I said to him:
777	2	38	`Lord, when someone has a vision, do they see it through the soul or the spirit?'
777	2	39	The Savior answered:
777	2	40	`They see not through the soul nor the spirit,
777	2	41	but the mind which exists in between the two which sees the vision,
777	2	42	and it is that...'''

777	3	44	``...and Desire said:
777	3	45	`I did not see you descending, but I now see you ascending.
777	3	46	Why do you lie since you belong to me?'
777	3	47	The soul said this:
777	3	48	`I saw you,
777	3	49	though you did not see me,
777	3	50	nor did you recognize me.
777	3	51	I was with you as with a garment,
777	3	52	and you never felt me.'
777	3	53	When the soul said these things, they went rejoicing greatly.
777	3	54	Again, they came toward the third hand of power: the Ignorance.
777	3	55	It asked the soul:
777	3	56	`Where are you going?
777	3	57	In wickedness they bound you.
777	3	58	They bound you, but you do not judge.'
777	3	59	And the soul said this:
777	3	60	`Why do you judge me when I have not judge?
777	3	61	They bound me though I did not bind.
777	3	62	They did not recognize me
777	3	63	but I have recognized
777	3	64	that all things break down,
777	3	65	both on earth and in heaven.'
777	3	66	When the soul had overcome the third power,
777	3	67	they went upwards and saw the fourth power.
777	3	68	It had seven forms:
777	3	69	the first form is the Darkness;
777	3	70	the second, the Desire;
777	3	71	the third, the Ignorance;
777	3	72	the fourth is the Zeal of Death;
777	3	73	the fifth is the Kingdom of the flesh;
777	3	74	the sixth is the Wisdom of fools of the flesh;
777	3	75	the seventh is the Wrathful Wisdom.
777	3	76	These are the seven powers of the Wrath.
777	3	77	They ask the soul:
777	3	78	`Where are you coming from, murderer?' and
777	3	79	`Where are you going, conqueror?'
777	3	80	The soul said:
777	3	81	`What bound me was slain and what dominated me has been dominated.
777	3	82	My desire was fulfilled and my ignorance is gone.
777	3	83	I was freed from this world by another,
777	3	84	which cannot be forgotten.
777	3	85	I will receive the repose of time for eternity in silence.'''
777	4	86	After Mary had finished speaking, she kept silent,
777	4	87	as that is as far as the Savior had told her.
777	4	88	Andrew turned to his brothers and said:
777	4	89	``What do you think about what she has told us?
777	4	90	As for myself, I don't believe that the Savior said these things,
777	4	91	as those ideas are too distant from our own.'' Then Peter replied:
777	4	92	``Would he speak with a woman about secrets which we ourselves would not know?
777	4	93	Should we turn and listen to her? Did he choose her over us?''
777	4	94	Then Mary began to weep:
777	4	95	``My brother Peter, what are you thinking? Do you think my heart made this up or that I would lie about our Savior?''
777	4	96	Levi then turned to Peter and said:
777	4	97	``Peter, you have always been wrathful,
777	4	98	and now I see you silencing this woman,
777	4	99	just as our adversaries do.
777	4	100	If the Savior found her worthy,
777	4	101	then who are you to reject her?
777	4	102	Surely the Savior knows her very well,
777	4	103	because he loved her more than us.
777	4	104	Rather, let us be ashamed of ourselves
777	4	105	and take in the purest human form that we acquired from Him,
777	4	106	like He commanded us.
777	4	107	We are to preach the gospel and not lay down any rules nor laws beyond what the Savior said.''
777	4	108	After Levi had said these things, they left and began to teach and preach the Gospel of the Kingdom.
